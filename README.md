notes for different type of fetch requst

1. Fetch API
2. Axios
3. Swr

NOTE
Swr help u to easilly get the data but not fetch API,
still have to use fetch API such as Axios or Fetch
optional chaining for handle the null situation
By using SWR, passing a {suspense:true} of loading indicator
SWR can also handling Error, by {data,error} = useSWR(URL,Fetch function,{a object that indicate the action of the API})

4. ReactQuery
